# Building Structure Projection — Interactive 3D Viewer

## Project Overview

This assignment involves creating An interactive 3D visualization system for building structure projection. The project loads a building defined in an XML file (e.g., `sample_input.xml`, modeled on the BUET cafeteria) and displays it as a navigable 3D scene. A sample rendering is provided as `sample_output.png`.

## Input File Explanation

The input file contains a set of surfaces defined by `<Surface>` tags.  
Each `<Surface>` includes two geometric descriptions: `<RectangularGeometry>` and `<PlanarGeometry>`.

- **Task 1**: Work only with the `<PlanarGeometry>` data.
- **Task 2**: Use both `<PlanarGeometry>` and `<RectangularGeometry>` data.

### `<PlanarGeometry>` Tag

- The `<PlanarGeometry>` tag defines the actual 3D shape of the surface.
- It contains a `<PolyLoop>` element, which includes a sequence of `<CartesianPoint>` entries.
- Each `<CartesianPoint>` represents a vertex coordinate of the surface in 3D space.
- A valid `<PolyLoop>` must contain **more than three** `<CartesianPoint>` elements to form a closed polygon.

### `<RectangularGeometry>` Tag

- The `<RectangularGeometry>` tag describes the surface using high-level rectangular parameters.
- It includes `<Azimuth>`, `<Tilt>`, `<Width>`, and `<Height>` to define the surface’s orientation and dimensions.
- The `<CartesianPoint>` inside `<RectangularGeometry>` provides a reference origin point from which the azimuth, tilt, width, height, and the corresponding `<PlanarGeometry>` coordinates are interpreted.

## Assignment Tasks

### Task 1: 3D Polygon Visualization (Core Requirement) (30%)

**Objective**: Create an interactive 3D visualization of the provided octagon using Three.js.

**Requirements**:
- Parse the geometry from the `sample_input.xml` file. Refer to the explanation of the `sample_input.xml` format above.
- Render the polygon in 3D space with the correct vertex sequence and edge connections.
- Include basic lighting, camera controls, and appropriate visual styling.


### Task 2: Make the Visualization User-Interactive (40%)

**Objective**: Enhance the visualization by adding surface and space interactivity.

**Requirements**:
- Provide a surface filtering option (e.g., a dropdown menu listing all `<Surface>` entries).
- When a surface is selected from the dropdown and the user clicks in the scene, the corresponding surface should be highlighted and displayed clearly in the 3D visualization created in Task 1.
- Provide a space filtering option (e.g., another dropdown listing all `<Space>` entries).
- When a space is selected, automatically display all surfaces that reference that space through the `AdjacentSpaceId` attribute.

### Task 3: Testing & Presentation Enhancements (30%)

**Objective**: Improve reliability, clarity, and visual quality of the project.

**Requirements**:
- Write unit test cases to validate the XML parsing logic (e.g., ensuring correct extraction of PolyLoop coordinates and `AdjacentSpaceId` mappings).
- Provide a clear `README.md` file explaining:
  - Project structure
  - How to run the visualization
  - Input file format summary
  - Any assumptions made
- Implement an advanced color-coding scheme to visually distinguish:
  - Different surface types (e.g., walls vs. roofs vs. shades)
  - Surfaces belonging to the selected space (highlighting adjacency relationships)
- Ensure the final output is polished, easy to understand, and reusable.
